Below is a discussion on a model implementation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for binary classification. 
The goal of this model is to predict whether a customer is a regular customer or not based on various features. Here's a summary of the key components of this model:
Dataset:

•	The dataset contains information about customers, including features such as points, branch, gender, age, years, spent amount, number of items, online payment, online orders, estimated salary, and a label indicating whether the customer is regular (1) or not (0).

•	The dataset is read from a CSV file named "hotel_data.csv."
Libraries:

Python libraries make it extremely simple for us to manipulate data and perform common and complex tasks with a single line of code. I imported the following libraries:
Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn and TensorFlow.

The following is the procedure I used to create this ANN:
i.	Importing Libraries and Dataset

ii.	Data Pre-processing

iii.	Building the ANN

iv.	Training the ANN

v.	Making Predictions and Evaluating the Model:
